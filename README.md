Tomorrow night todos:     
1. The table component in material-ui look like this, I have to find customization way or design the table component by myselg.     
2. Implement the region bar component.

Day3 Note   
If I delay implement test case to weekend, I will lose the benifit of write test case before implement component, so I add mocha, and try to write test case for the region bar component.   
> Sorry facing with problem, still delay to weekend.    


The table component, I should implement the table without the help from material-ui's table component.
